# NodeJS REST API boilerplate
A simple NodeJS REST API boilerplate to easily start off your projects

It includes a basic index.js which contains some CORS configurations, and Helmet which improves security by adding additional security headers to requests.

Also it includes basic templates for GET, POST, DELETE and PATCH requests.

Currently the repo has a simple mysql connection example implemented, and I'm also planning on adding mssql (WIP), mongodb and postgresql examples too.
